## Design Patterns

This repository contains my assignments for the "Pattern and Software Design" course. It includes implementations of design patterns with code examples to demonstrate my understanding of software design concepts.

> [!NOTE]
> The documentation for each pattern is not yet complete. I will write it later.

### Creational Patterns

Creational design patterns provide various object creation mechanisms, which increase flexibility and reuse of existing code.

- [Factory Method](/patterns/creational/factory_method/)
- [Abstract Factory](/patterns/creational/abstract_factory/)
- [Builder](/patterns/creational/builder/)
- [Prototype](/patterns/creational/prototype/)
- [Singleton](/patterns/creational/singleton/)

### Structural Patterns

Structural design patterns explain how to assemble objects and classes into larger structures, while keeping these structures flexible and efficient.

- [Adapter](/patterns/structural/adapter/)
- [Bridge](/patterns/structural/bridge/)
- [Composite](/patterns/structural/composite/)
- [Decorator](/patterns/structural/decorator/)
- [Facade](/patterns/structural/facade/)
- [Flyweight](/patterns/structural/flyweight/)
- [Proxy](/patterns/structural/proxy/)

### Behavioral Patterns

Behavioral design patterns are concerned with algorithms and the assignment of responsibilities between objects.

- [Chain of Responsibility](/patterns/behavioral/chain_of_responsibility/)
- [Command](/patterns/behavioral/command/)
- [Iterator](/patterns/behavioral/iterator/)
- [Mediator](/patterns/behavioral/mediator/)
- [Memento](/patterns/behavioral/memento/)
- [Observer](/patterns/behavioral/observer/)
- [State](/patterns/behavioral/state/)
- [Strategy](/patterns/behavioral/strategy/)
- [Template Method](/patterns/behavioral/template_method/)
- [Visitor](/patterns/behavioral/visitor/)

### Project

For my final project, I created an application that integrates multiple design patterns:

- [Mix Patterns](/patterns/mix/)
